### Summary
In finalization I would recommend a bikesharing startup in Des Moines and focus your marketing toward Males and have
bikes ready for rental during the peak weekday times of 7am to 9am and 5pm to 7pm. If there are alot of visitors
to Des Moines on the weekend then focus on renting bikes to visitors.

I would like to see geographical data like a breakdown of age and race to get a more accurate chart to focus the bike rental
marketing strategies.
